# hash-table-y-luby-s-algorithm
→ This is a final delivery for the parallel programming class at our university, here we will present 2 algorithms which are the Hash-table and Luby's algorithm, they will be presented with normal execution and with parallel execution.

→ To run both algorithms, we will need to have python installed on our computers, whether we work with the normal algorithm or the parallelized one:

        Python Download:
        https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

→ This is the documentation of the libraries that we need to install for the parallel algorithms to work correctly:

        Numba Documentation:
        https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/index.html 

        NumPy Documentation:
        https://numpy.org/doc/

→ Each file can be executed independently, since each one handles its own information and is used to test different algorithms, running in a traditional way as well as in parallel.
